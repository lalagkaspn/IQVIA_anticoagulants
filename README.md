# Anticoagulant utilization in Greece, 2018–2022: trends and time-series forecasts

In this work, we aim to quantify national trends in ambulatory anticoagulant consumption in Greece during 2018–2022 and to forecast utilization through 2030 using standardized drug-utilization metrics (Defined Daily Dose/1,000 inhabitants/day). To achieve this, we conduct a retrospective pharmacoepidemiological analysis of national anticoagulant sales data provided by IQVIA Hellas. This data represents community pharmacy sales and we use it as a proxy for population-level drug use. For each anticoauglant drug, we examine drug-specific temporal trends and train SARIMA models to forecast consumption through 2030. Our main conculsion is that anticoagulant utilization in Greece has shifted toward direct oral anticoagulants with concurrent declines in vitamin K antagonists.

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to perform the data analysis (Anticoagulants_analysis.ipynb), as well as the corresponding conda environment (environment.ylm). The notebook requires as input a table where the first column contains month/year inputs (e.g., 01/2018) and following columns contain monthly DDD/1,000 inhabitants/day values (one column per drug). However, we are not allowed to re-distribute the IQVUA Hellas data used in this analysis. Therefore, the notebook cannot be executed succesfully without access to the original dataset. We simply provide it for reference and transparency in case you want to see what we did.
